/*: ### Challenge 1: Adding raw values
 Take the coin example from earlier in the chapter then begin with the following array of coins:
 
 ```
 enum Coin: Int {
 case penny = 1
 case nickel = 5
 case dime = 10
 case quarter = 25
 }
 let coinPurse: [Coin] =
 [.penny, .quarter, .nickel, .dime, .penny, .dime, .quarter]
 ```
 
 Write a function where you can pass in the array of coins, add up the value and then return the number of cents.
 */

enum Coin: Int {
    case penny = 1
    case nickel = 5
    case dime = 10
    case quarter = 25
}

let coinPurse: [Coin] = [.penny, .quarter, .nickel, .dime, .penny, .dime, .quarter]

func sumOfCoins(_ coins: [Coin]) -> Int {
    coins.map { $0.rawValue }.reduce(0, +)
}

sumOfCoins(coinPurse)


/*: ### Challenge 2: Computing with raw values
 Take the example from earlier in the chapter and begin with the Month enumeration:
 
 
 ```
 enum Month: Int {
 case january = 1, february, march, april, may, june, july, august, september, october, november, december
 }
 ```
 
 Write a computed property to calculate the number of months until summer.
 
 Hint: Youâ€™ll need to account for a negative value if summer has already passed in the current year. To do that, imagine looping back around for the next full year.
 */

enum Month: Int {
    case january = 1, february, march, april, may, june, july, august, september, october, november, december
    
    // Summer in US is June, Summer in PH is March
    // Solution 1
    //    var monthsUntilSummer: Int {
    //        if Month.june.rawValue < self.rawValue {
    //            return (Month.december.rawValue - self.rawValue) + Month.june.rawValue
    //        } else {
    //            return Month.june.rawValue - self.rawValue
    //        }
    //    }
    
    // Solution 2
    var monthsUntilSummer: Int {
        var monthsLeft = Month.june.rawValue - self.rawValue
        if monthsLeft < 0 {
            monthsLeft += 12
        }
        
        return monthsLeft
    }
}

let julyMonth = Month.july
julyMonth.monthsUntilSummer




/*: ### Challenge 3: Pattern matching enumeration values
 
 Take the map example from earlier in the chapter and begin with the Direction enumeration:
 
 ```
 enum Direction {
 case north
 case south
 case east
 case west
 }
 ```
 
 
 Imagine starting a new level in a video game. The character makes a series of movements in the game. Calculate the position of the character on a top-down level map after making a set of movements:
 
 ```
 let movements: [Direction] = [.north, .north, .west, .south,
 .west, .south, .south, .east, .east, .south, .east]
 ```
 
 Use tuple for the location:
 ```
 var location = (x: 0, y: 0)
 ```
 */


enum Direction {
    case north
    case south
    case east
    case west
}

let movements: [Direction] = [.north, .north, .west, .south, .west, .south, .south, .east, .east, .south, .east]


func calculatePosition(_ movements: [Direction]) -> (x: Int, y: Int) {
    var location = (x: 0, y: 0)
    
    for movement in movements {
        switch movement {
        case .north:
            location.y += 1
        case .south:
            location.y -= 1
        case .west:
            location.x -= 1
        case .east:
            location.x += 1
        }
    }
    
    return location
}

calculatePosition(movements)
