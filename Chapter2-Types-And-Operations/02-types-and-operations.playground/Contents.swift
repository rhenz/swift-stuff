//: Mini Exercise

// 1. Declare a constant tuple that contains three Int values followed by a Double. Use this to represent a date (month, day, year) followed by an average temperature for that date.
let someTuple = (5, 5, 2022, 30.0)

// 2. Change the tuple to name the constituent components. Give them names related to the data they contain: month, day, year and averageTemperature.
let someTuple2 = (month: 5, day: 5, year: 2022, averageTemperature: 30.0)

// 3. In one line, read the day and average temperature values into two constants. You‚Äôll need to employ the underscore to ignore the month and year.
let (_, day, _, averageTemp) = someTuple2
day
averageTemp

// 4. Up until now, you‚Äôve only seen constant tuples. But you can create variable tuples, too. Change the tuple you created in the exercises above to a variable by using var instead of let. Now change the average temperature to a new value.
var mutableTuple = (month: 5, day: 5, year: 2022, averageTemperature: 30.0)
mutableTuple.averageTemperature = 35

//: Type aliases

//: Challenges

// 1. Create a constant called coordinates and assign a tuple containing two and three to it.

let someCoordinates = (2, 3)

// 2. Create a constant called namedCoordinate with a row and column component.
let namedCoordinate = (row: 2, column: 3)


/*
 3. Which of the following are valid statements?
 
 let character: Character = "Dog" // invalid
 let character: Character = "üê∂" // valid
 let string: String = "Dog" // valid
 let string: String = "üê∂" // valid
 */


/*
 4. Does it compile?
 
 let tuple = (day: 15, month: 8, year: 2015)
 let day = tuple.Day
 
 ANSWER: no, it should be tuple.day not tuple.Day

/*
 5. Find the error
 
    let name = "Matt" // should not be declared as a constant
    name += " Galloway"
 */


/*
 6. What is the type of the constant named value?
    let tuple = (100, 1.5, 10)
    let value = tuple.1
 
 ANSWER: Double
 */

/*
7. What is the value of the constant named month?

    let month = tuple.month
 
 ANSWER: Int
 */

/*
 8. What is the value of the constant named summary?
 
 let number = 10
 let multiplier = 5
 let summary = "\(number) multiplied by \(multiplier) equals \(number * multiplier)"
 
 ANSWER: 10 multiplied by 5 equals 50

 9. What is the sum of a and b, minus c?

/*
 10. What is the numeric difference between Double.pi and Float.pi?
 
 ANSWER: Float.pi is less precised than the Double.pi and it takes less storage than Double.pi
