//: Write a function memberOf(person: Person, group: [Person]) -> Bool that will return true if person can be found inside group, and false if it can not. Test it by creating two arrays of five Person objects for group and using john as the person. Put john in one of the arrays, but not in the other.

//: Add a computed property to Student that returns the studentâ€™s Grade Point Average or GPA. A GPA is defined as the number of points earned divided by the number of credits taken. For the example above, Jane earned (9 + 16 = 25) points while taking (3 + 4 = 7) credits, making her GPA (25 / 7 = 3.57).


struct Grade {
    let letter: String
    let points: Double

        let totalGrades = grades.map { $0.points }.reduce(0, +)
